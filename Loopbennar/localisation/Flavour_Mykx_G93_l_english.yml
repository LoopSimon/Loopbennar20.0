 G93_replenish_scourge_fleet_title:0 "Replenish Scourge Fleet"
 G93_replenish_scourge_fleet_desc:0 "When Mykx led her people to Aelantir, they were but a fleet fit for raiding the Divenhal Sea.\n\nAs such the fleet suffered a lot and many ships have been decommissioned, scutaged or mothballed since the journey began. It is time to regrow our strength on the seas."

 G93_expand_secondary_docks_title:0 "Conquered Docks Plan"
 G93_expand_secondary_docks_desc:0 "The Docks of our rivals need to be ours and they need to be fully operational. This would allow our fleets to operate both eastwards and westwards with more ease."

 G93_the_troll_toll_title:0 "The Troll Toll"
 G93_the_troll_toll_desc:0 "The seas of the Trollsbay is rife with plunder, not a day goes by without a ship carrying treasure either arrives from or leaves for Cannor. We should test how profitable it would be to set up a privateer fleet there, we shall make the locals pay a toll in either riches or blood!"

 G93_naval_and_smuggle_plans_title:0 "Infrastructure for Our Navy"
 G93_naval_and_smuggle_plans_desc:0 "If our Scourge Fleet is going to keep our islands safe, it needs to be large, well supplied and in pristine condition. \n\nTo this end our naval advisors have planned a huge increase in the amount of dockyards that will serve our navy."

 G93_ruined_sea_monopoly_title:0 "Ruined Sea Monopoly"
 G93_ruined_sea_monopoly_desc:0 "Outsiders might think we sustain entirely off of raiding, nothing is less true. Trade between our various islands is a vital part of our economy. To this end we should seek to conquer and colonize all the natural harbours and major trade ports in the region and make sure they are properly exploited."

 G93_docks_for_our_ships_title:0 "A Dock for Our Ships"
 G93_docks_for_our_ships_desc:0 "When Mykx took the Scourge Fleet and maneuvered it to Aelantir, we arrived with nothing but our ships, badly damaged by the perilous journey and weeks without repair. \n\nWe lost many ships during those times, we have managed to repair the damage, but our fleet is still in dire need of both reinforcements and a safe haven. Our capital is an obvious location for such a grand dockyard."

 G93_the_calasanni_title:0 "The Calasanni"
 G93_the_calasanni_desc:0 "The Cannorians are planning to establish a colony to our south, on a group of isles that obviously fall within our domain. It is now up to us to ensure that they realise that too."

 G93_fate_of_the_calasanni_title:0 "Fate of the Calasanni"
 G93_fate_of_the_calasanni_desc:0 "With the Calasanni in our grasp we can decide their fate..."

 G93_followers_of_saamir_title:0 "Followers of Saamir"
 G93_followers_of_saamir_desc:0 "The Bulwari are planning to establish a colony to our west, they harbour anti-gnoll and anti-krah (our word for slavery) sentiment. They are also heavily investing into their navy, such a power cannot be allowed to exist."

 G93_set_the_sun_on_saamir_title:0 "Set the Sun on Saamir"
 G93_set_the_sun_on_saamir_desc:0 "With the Bulwari in our grasp we can decide their fate..."

 G93_collecting_our_bearings_title:0 "Collecting Our Bearings"
 G93_collecting_our_bearings_desc:0 "Our state is disoriented, like a gnoll whelp after their first pint of ale. If we are to remedy this, we should seek to dissipate the fog that is the great unknown of our new world. Let us map our surroundings so we can sober up."

 G93_securing_our_surroundings_title:0 "Securing Our Surroundings"
 G93_securing_our_surroundings_desc:0 "Explorers have returned with maps, which state these seas are even more rife with islands than we could have hoped. Back in Akasik the amount of isles in Viakkoc's domain could usually be counted on one hand, out here, Mykx could one day hold countless islands! Let us start colonizing at once, prioritising the nearby isles first."

 G93_wealth_of_the_north_title:0 "Wealth To The North"
 G93_wealth_of_the_north_desc:0 "Back in Viakkoc, true wealth was found to the north, where the Cannorians live. Again we find Cannorians to our north and again their coasts are rife with wealth! \n\nWe should map these coasts immediately, so that we can carefully conduct our raids."

 G93_raiders_of_noruin_title:0 "Raiders Of Noruin"
 G93_raiders_of_noruin_desc:0 "With the coast of Noruin mapped, we should increase our reach so that both our captains and our fleet can successfully raid every single coastal town and city in Noruin. \n\nIn fact, we should raid them all to see which ones are the richest!"

 G93_proclaim_grand_republic_of_mykx_title:0 "Proclaim Grand Republic"
 G93_proclaim_grand_republic_of_mykx_desc:0 "Our islands can no longer be counted on one hand, or on two for that matter. Our Fleet is bigger, stronger, feared and well supplied. Not a day goes by that our Everpyre does not sacrifice a soul to the demons. Our state is more stable and wealthy than ever before. We are truly grand in every way of the word. It is time to let the rest of the world know!\n\nIt is time for a feast of epic proportions!"

 G93_punishments_in_the_pirate_code_title:0 "Punishment Articles"
 G93_punishments_in_the_pirate_code_desc:0 "Every port and especially every captain has their own laws. These laws, usually written down as a set of articles, or passed on verbally in smaller communities, differ wildly depending on whose town you're in or what ship you're on.\n\nFor example: Some fearsome captains force those who withhold treasure to walk the plank, whilst others maroon them, others yet give them lashes.\n\nThese discrepancies bring our realm a great degree of chaos, as criminals can lessen their punishment merely by jumping on or off of a ship or fleeing to another island. We must centralize the punishments."

 G93_dwarves_on_ships_title:0 "Dwarves on Ships"
 G93_dwarves_on_ships_desc:0 "When we first saw dwarves on ships, this far from Ovdal Tûngr, we thought maybe they had finally fallen to Viakkoc, for no dwarf in their right mind would go this far from the mountains that protect their wealth. Yet here they are... \n\nLet us spy on their settlements and plunder their coasts to see if we can take them..."

 G93_fate_of_the_dwarves_title:0 "Fate of the Dwarves"
 G93_fate_of_the_dwarves_desc:0 "With the dwarves in our grasp we can decide their fate..."

 G93_repair_graxarr_temple_title:0 "Repair Graxarr Temple"
 G93_repair_graxarr_temple_desc:0 "When we launched our expedition to the temple, we were impressed by the architecture, its size and shape reminds us of some of the nobles' houses from the city of Anbenncóst back home. Yet it is clearly much older and the material is much sturdier. Repairing the fallen pillars, collapsed tunnels and broken stairs is going to take time and resources... Perhaps we can get the dwarves to do it..."

 G93_graxarr_everpyre_title:0 "Graxarr Everpyre"
 G93_graxarr_everpyre_desc:0 "With the temple repaired and the Kult having taken its place on the isle, voices have been raised to construct a §Y Pyre §!atop the temple that will be continuously fed both wood and bodies. The Kult wishes for the state to allocate funds for such a project, and sees it as a good place to host the majority of the states sacrificial rituals, as it would allow the Kult to keep close oversight and to counter any unwanted side-effects. To this end they wish for a fort to be constructed around the temple, not only to more easily gather slaves but also to deal with any demonic rifts that might appear."

 G93_articles_on_the_crippled_and_limbless_title:0 "The Crippled and Limbless"
 G93_articles_on_the_crippled_and_limbless_desc:0 "Many Buccaneers are unhappy, their line of duty is a dangerous one, yet when they get seriously injured, not all captains are willing to compensate the crippled crewmate properly. Some towns which are often visited by particularly ruthless captains have their streets filled with crippled beggars, who weren't fairly compensated at all.\n\nBuccaneers are petitioning for the state to pass a nationwide law to ensure the Article on compensation for the crippled is equal on every ship. Such a reform would also help those people pay for doctors, and thus hopefully enter the workforce once more."

 G93_articles_on_settling_disputes_title:0 "Settling Disputes"
 G93_articles_on_settling_disputes_desc:0 "A Pier-Rag is a gnoll or slave whose job it is to clean the docks of corpses, blood and guts. Not every dock has one, but most do. \n\nDuels are commonplace in Mykx, and a primary way to settle disputes in both gnoll and pirate society. However many captains forbid infighting on their ships, as such, pirates often collect their grudges whilst onboard, until the ship docks into port and they can draw their weapons on one another a few steps off of the plank.\n\nMany captains are calling for reform, as the dueling culture is costing them valuable crewmembers..."

 G93_articles_on_government_contracts_title:0 "Government Contracts"
 G93_articles_on_government_contracts_desc:0 "Officials from all over Mykx have been calling for reform, as captains are zealously spilling blood in towns after they have been hired by town guards to do their jobs for them...\n\nThese are not the only types of contracts state officials are issuing to citizens, and the amount of pirates who falsely claim to be hired by the state in order to extort (or worse) are said to be on the rise.\n\nPerhaps it is time to regulate the empowering of citizens by state officials..."

 G93_articles_on_standardized_prize_shares_title:0 "Standardized Prize Shares"
 G93_articles_on_standardized_prize_shares_desc:0 "Whenever loot is acquired on a ship, it is divided along certain rules. Most ships assign different weights to different occupations, for example a boy will only get half the share of the prize that a regular crewmember would get. The boatswain, oarsman and doctor would usually get significantly more shares, but the captain almost always takes the largest chunk of the loot.\n\nOn some ships however the captain only takes around four shares of the prize (four times as many as a crewmember), whilst on others they take as much as forty shares. Such discrepancies are leading to heated debate for regulations, as many fear that if captains grow too rich, they will pose dangers to the state. Naturally many Buccaneers would love to see captain shares limited, so those that they represent would see their pay increased."

 G93_every_ship_an_observer_title:0 "Every Ship an Observer"
 G93_every_ship_an_observer_desc:0 "The state has issued many nationwide articles for our captains to adhere to, yet not all wish to listen. We should place a government official on every significant vessel, to ensure no tax is dodged and no rule is broken."

 G93_vanbury_ships_title:0 "The Vanbury People"
 G93_vanbury_ships_desc:0 "Rumor has it a group of rich Cannorians, calling themselves the Vanbury Guild, have set their eyes on a large island to our west. It would be wise to investigate these rumours."

 G93_vanbury_gold_title:0 "Vanbury Harbour"
 G93_vanbury_gold_desc:0 "This island, which the humans have taken to calling Vanburia, has a natural harbour so deep, not a single wave can hit it. This port will one day be very important, we should seek to raid or conquer it for ourselves!" 

 G93_gate_to_the_west_title:0 "Gate to the West"
 G93_gate_to_the_west_desc:0 "Vanburia needs to be ours and the port in its natural harbour needs to be of high standard, only then can we exert our influence upon the western natives of Aelantir."

 G93_scourge_of_kheionai_title:0 "Scourge of Kheionai"
 G93_scourge_of_kheionai_desc:0 "Kheionai is rich in people, gold and precursor relics. At least, for now. We must establish local outposts and raid their richest coastal cities, to fund our industry and economy. They think the seas around their isles are theirs, they are mistaken: We will be the scourge of Kheionai!"

 G93_scourge_of_south_aelantir_title:0 "Scourge of South Aelantir"
 G93_scourge_of_south_aelantir_desc:0 "A huge market for export of Demon's Blood and enormous potential for raiding can be found in South Aelantir. Every Trade Port we establish boosts our economy significantly, so it seems evident that we should try to cover the entire coast of the continent in them."

 G93_window_to_the_far_west_title:0 "Window to the Far West"
 G93_window_to_the_far_west_desc:0 "When we sailed west from Viakkoc and landed in Ilzin Mykx, we did not expect such wealth to exploit. When we sailed west from Ilzin Mykx and found Vanburia, we found more wealth. When we sailed west from Vanburia and raided Eordand and Kheionai, we found wealth beyond imagining. Now, we must go even further west, beyond the ocean, beyond the storms, to find even greater wealth."

 G93_banished_isles_title:0 "Banished Harbours"
 G93_banished_isles_desc:0 "When we first sailed to our new homeland, we sailed beyond the Banished Isles because we wanted to create an insurmountable distance between us and the fleets of Viakkoc. Now we no longer fear them, and we can once again look east. The Banished Isles are being colonized by Cannorians, and elves, and will one day be a vital crossroads for trade between Aelantir and Cannor. We must ensure we have good maps of the region so we can begin planning expansion."

 G93_banished_trade_title:0 "Banished Isles"
 G93_banished_trade_desc:0 "With our horizon broadened after the declaration of the Grand Republic of Mykx, it has become evident that the Banished Isles to our east belong not to elves and humans, but to us gnolls. The coastal plains, inland jungles and natural harbours belong to our people."

 G93_sella_export_title:0 "Sella Export"
 G93_sella_export_desc:0 "The Blood Bringers are petitioning the state to secure ports of operation for them in Noruin, with an a lot of their sights set on the Sella Estuary."

 G93_research_demons_blood_title:0 "Research Demon's Blood"
 G93_research_demons_blood_desc:0 "The smugglers of Mykx are always looking for new goods to export, be it slaves, precursor relics, narcotics or weapons. This Demon's Blood seems promising... We should allocate resources for such a project."

 G93_start_mass_production_title:0 "Start Mass Production"
 G93_start_mass_production_desc:0 "In order to start producing Demon's Blood in such a quantity that it can both supply our internal market and a potential external market, we need to secure vital resources, ramp up our resource production and redesign our trade port infrastructure.\n\nOne of those resources are a rare type of mushroom procured from Parura Leechden Ruinborn, who say they sail up the rivers in Machunana for them."

 G93_cheshoshmar_export_title:0 "Cheshoshmar Export"
 G93_cheshoshmar_export_desc:0 "The coastal city of Cheshosh'tchuka has been of particular interest to multiple factions in the realm for a long time: The smugglers would like to tap into its abundancy of precursor relics more easily and the Xhazobkult would like to see if the renowned Bone Citadel can be repurposed into a grand temple for the kult that dwarves even Graxarr. Now the Blood Bringers are also pushing for the state to conquer the province and allow them to use it to export Demon's Blood into Cheshoshmar from there."

 G93_great_bone_citadel_title:0 "Great Bone Citadel"
 G93_great_bone_citadel_desc:0 "The Blood Bringers aren't the only ones interested in the province of Cheshosh'tchuka. The Xhazobkult sees the Bone Citadel as a structure with great potential for their organisation. Early visits indicate that it is a place of great magical potential, but the local population will have to be 'dealt with' before the kult is willing to send anyone important."

 G93_the_citadel_repaired_title:0 "Repair the Citadel"
 G93_the_citadel_repaired_desc:0 "The Xhazobkult has shown to be very interested in the Bone Citadel and they want any damage done to it during our conquest of the are and the subsequent looting to be properly repaired."

 G93_the_citadel_expanded_title:0 "Expand the Citadel"
 G93_the_citadel_expanded_desc:0 "With the fate of the Everpyre settled, the kult once more turns it gaze upon what they claim to be 'the limitless potential of the Bone Citadel and its spiritual connection to the demonic realm.' \nThey wish for the Citadel to become greater than it ever was under the reign of the Cheshoshi, so that the demons know we are their true servants, who are worthy of reward."

 G93_a_promise_fulfilled_title:0 "A Promise Fulfilled"
 G93_a_promise_fulfilled_desc:0 "The demons have made their demands and stated their rewards, it is now up to us to fulfill their demands and create the most demonic ritual this continent and perhaps even the world has ever seen."

 G93_scourge_of_eordand_title:0 "Scourge of Eordand"
 G93_scourge_of_eordand_desc:0 "Eordand has a rich coast which sports coastal cities that export precursor relics. These cities are obvious targets for our ships, who never stop looking for new plunder.\n\nIf we can ensure a sizeable plunder of precursor relics from this area, we can set out our own trade of the resource, whilst humiliating the locals."

 G93_blood_and_gold_initiative_title:0 "Blood and Gold Initiative"
 G93_blood_and_gold_initiative_desc:0 "The Blood and Gold Initiative is a proposed initiative that would require a large amount of state resources to kickstart. It would entail drafting up plans of conquest for every significant port in Aelantir and ramping up Demon's Blood production to handle the expected increase in export potential. \n\nSuch ambitions would alienate foreigners even further, but we do not need their approval, we only need their ports! \n\nBefore such plans can be drafted, we first need to obtain enough experience regarding the conquest of foreign ports and the establishment of trade ports."

 G93_scourge_of_north_aelantir_title:0 "Scourge Of North Aelantir"
 G93_scourge_of_north_aelantir_desc:0 "Not a single region on the continent must be without a safe harbour for our smugglers, Blood Bringers and navies. When we have achieved that, we will truly be an unstoppable scourge for the northerners."

 G93_cannorian_crave_title:0 "The Cannorian Crave"
 G93_cannorian_crave_desc:0 "Our historians remember it well: When we were still a part of Viakkoc, the Cannorians were insatiable. No matter how many narcotics we smuggled into their ports, they always wanted more.\n\nNow we shall give it to them!"

 G93_structure_the_electorate_title:0 "Structure The Electorate"
 G93_structure_the_electorate_desc:0 "We must construct the right institutions to ensure our republic has fair and stable elections. To this end we should gather advisors and make drafts for a set of rules for future elections." 

 G93_expand_the_bureaucracy_title:0 "Expand The Bureaucracy"
 G93_expand_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "When we arrived here, we were no more than a fleet, now we are a burgeoning state, yet sometimes it still feels like we are administratively handicapped. To ameliorate this issue, a plan has been drafted to increase our administrative capacities, but it would require serious investments into Ilzin Mykx."

 G93_trollsbay_export_title:0 "Trollsbay Export"
 G93_trollsbay_export_desc:0 "The Blood Bringers desire to expand their export capabilities to the Trollsbay, to facilitate this, they require a port they can safely enter."

 G93_privateer_reforms_title:0 "Privateer Reforms"
 G93_privateer_reforms_desc:0 "The privateers of our great nation show admirable initiative and strength. They instill fear in many coastal towns. Yet they are poorly organised: Occasionally fighting over loot, trying to plunder a town that has been plundered by their colleagues a mere month ago or even plundering each other's ships.\n\nThe privateers need a restructuring. The way this will go depends on which one of the three traditional pirate factions is currently in charge."

 G93_smuggler_funding_act_title:0 "Smuggler Funding Act"
 G93_smuggler_funding_act_desc:0 "If repairing the Bone Citadel has taught us anything, it is that dwarven slaves are useful. If we had to draw another lesson, it would be that it is often difficult for our state to acquire the resources for large construction projects, causing the projects to be slow, costly and underwhelming. A draft has been presented by influential smugglers, who wouldn't mind becoming official contractors of the state, supplying Mykx with much needed construction resources.\n\nWhat they want in return is expressed in something other than coin, some law changes to skewer elections in their favour... Who cares?"

 G93_captain_retiree_programme_title:0 "Captain Retirees"
 G93_captain_retiree_programme_desc:0 "It is not unheard of for a once great captain to fall into abject poverty due to injury, misfortune or age and be forced to roam the streets, begging for coin. Such a phenomena is both a shame for our nation and a waste of experienced individuals. A new plan to create a commission that can allot retired captains government positions has been gaining traction, especially within the Captains faction. Such a system would surely protect our heroes and allow for more experienced advisors to find their way to our court."

 G93_form_the_marine_corps_title:0 "Form The Marine Corps"
 G93_form_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "Our army and our navy need to be more intertwined in order to achieve greater military success. That is the conclusion of a recent report from a team of officials. They claim that the best way to achieve this is to train a fraction of our army to be especially experienced in sea travel, disembarking and coastal battles. It is time to form the marine corps."

 G93_build_the_naval_academy_title:0 "Build The Naval Academy"
 G93_build_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "With the Marine Corps formed, the gazes of our military reformers now fall upon the chaotic state of our navy. Many sailors have not had basic fire, climbing or combat training. It is okay for our slaves to be incompetent for they just have to row, but our own gnollish sailors being untrained is an unnecessary disgrace.\n\nMilitary reformers wish for the state to allot funds to establish a naval academy close to Ilzin Mykx, on Graxilzin."

 G93_swimming_exams_title:0 "Swimming Exams"
 G93_swimming_exams_desc:0 "Gnolls hate water, so much so that the streets are empty when it rains. You can imagine then that despite their culture being rather naval oriented, they aren't particularly fond of swimming. So much so that a large percentage of the gnollish population, even the sailors, cannot in fact swim. This makes the sinking of one of Mykx's ships a total disaster: The gurgled screams of drowning gnolls can be heard across the entire naval battlefield as soon as the first gnoll ship starts sinking. Not only is this bad for morale, it is also an unnecessary loss of sailors. To remedy this issue, teachers from the naval academy have started giving swimming lessons, to the dismay of their students\n\nThe teachers now wish for our administrators to retroactively test all current sailors for swimming capabilities, or send them back to the academy for some quick lessons."

 G93_great_dockyards_project_title:0 "Great Dockyards"
 G93_great_dockyards_project_desc:0 "With our navy and army thoroughly reformed, state advisors argue that the next step for the [Root.GovernmentName] of Mykx is to improve our logistics in and around the Ruined Sea. To this end these advisors wish for the dockyards of several prominent ports in strategic locations to be thoroughly expanded. This would facilite quicker naval repairs and constructions."

 G93_naval_adminstrators_title:0 "Naval Administrators"
 G93_naval_adminstrators_desc:0 "The expansion of our bureaucratic capacity has been successful, but not severe enough. With many administrators preferring cushy jobs in Ilzin Mykx, a severe loss of administrative capability occurs in faraway provinces. The well paid administrators simply do not wish to move to backwater towns to collect taxes and uphold laws. \n\nA innovative plan would have small to medium-sized coastal towns not be administered by government personnel living there, but rather by administrators who travel by boat from a central large coastal town to a series of nearby towns and villages to do their job.\n\nIn order to facilitate this project, the state will need to ensure those larger towns have access to solid naval infrastructure, so all administrators of a region can dock their ships when needed."

 G93_better_than_burying_title:0 "Better Than Burying"
 G93_better_than_burying_desc:0 "It has become increasingly common for gnoll captains to bury their treasure, that is, if legends are to be believed. This poses a problem, according to finanicial advisors. Not only because the wealth cannot be taxed, but also because it disappears from the economy, instead of circulating. A solution has been proposed, to open up a national bank, and what better place to do so than in the town of Traveller's Rest, where not too long ago, dwarves tried to do the same.\n\nWe can repurpose some of their buildings and even use some dwarven slaves to help us administer the bank."

 G93_cannon_standardisation_title:0 "Cannon Standardisation"
 G93_cannon_standardisation_desc:0 "With some of the dwarves of our nation finally swapping their rowing duties for banking duties, some have begun getting used to their increased living standard and have started small businesses, with the permission of their masters of course.\n\nOne such dwarven slave has set up a cannon production facility and is supplying both the army and the navy. His cannons are starting to build a reputation, because of their quality and uniformity. His master claims his dwarf is a descendant from a long line of smiths and has petitioned the government to adopt his methods of cannon-smithing.\n\nAdvisors agree it is time to standardize the circumference of our cannons into a singular size and to start letting foreigners aid our designs. A factory is to be constructed in the town of Wanderer's Bay, which will need ample copper and iron to operate at full capacity."

 G93_declare_scourge_of_all_seas_title:0 "True Scourge Of All Seas"
 G93_declare_scourge_of_all_seas_desc:0 "Our great nation can no longer be considered just another state, we are truly the hegemon of Aelantir. Our influence stretches across countless seas and every continent knows of our plunderers, privateers, smugglers and drugs. We are the true Scourge Of All Seas, and it is time for everyone, including Viakkoc, who has falsely claimed that title for centuries, to feel that!\n\nThrow a huge feast and prepare a message to be spread across all of Halann!"

 mykx.4.a:0 "Saamiršes is ours."
 mykx.5.t:0 "The Ruined Isles"
 mykx.5.d:0 "As it has become clear in the past few months that there are fertile isles all around us, colonisation seems to be a strategically sound option. Gnolls have begun striking deals, investing in colonial ventures and some are even selling their homes in [Root.Capital.GetName] for a spot on a venture to greener pastures.\n\nWith an age of colonialism ahead of us we need to start preparing colonial infrastructure immediately..."
 mykx.5.a:0 "Time to shift our priorities"
 mykx.5.b:0 "We must not overextend ourselves"
 mykx.6.t:0 "Graxarr Expedition"
 mykx.6.d:0 "When word from the explorers who first saw Graxarr Temple from the sea reached the government in Ilzin Mykx, they were ecstatic: A large Precursor structure still standing?\n\nIt was an alluring sight, our older folk back in the Divenhal remembered how rare and rich those vessels carrying alleged Precursor Relics were. And now that we were in Aelantir, we would be getting the real stuff right from the source.\n\nNow that the isle is firmly within our grasp, an expedition has been organised to find out just how much bounty is hidden within. This is their report:\n\nDeep in the jungle of Graxarr, a circular array of towers dominates the landscape, with not even a single vine having grown on them. At the base of the towers is a floor made of solid white stone which gives way to multiple winding staircases, as well as gilded doors leading inside the towers.\n\nWhile said doors were easy enough to yank off, most of the doors inside have proven too thick to break through with our current equipment, resulting in our exploration teams coming to dead end after dead end. Eventually we found a hallway with open doors, which led us to a large room in which we recovered various trinkets. One of the captains who was with us said it reminded her of the cargo she once seized from a Brasanni ship headed to Cannor, and went on to entertain the crew with the tale of her exploit on the way back to [Root.Capital.GetName]. We could not make more progress as further exploitation seems to require mining equipment.\n\nWhat should be done with the relics?"

This is necessary to ensure truces are upheld, taxes from raids are paid to the government and all captains who are on the republican navy payroll get due compensation for their work. \n\nWith the new laws in place, making the national navy available for raiding is now far more profitable for the captains who make up our navy, as such, trust in the government will rise if we ensure a plentitude of raids. \n\nIf we are to reach the wealth in the north however, we need nearby safe havens for our ships to operate from. To this end we should push any foreign settlers who may have claimed such isles out, if we deem it necessary."

As it turns out a group of drug dealers had made it onto the ship and had begun selling a new and upcoming drug to the crowd, they call it 'Demon's Blood'. It makes one unable to feel pain and it enhances emotions such as joy, anger and lust. If enough is snorted it can even bring one closer to the realm of the demons and allow one to communicate with them. \n\nThis drug is clearly still in an experimental phase, as demonstrated by the fact that three gnolls had already died before the ship reached Graxarr, with one even managing to summon a demon as they vomited out their lungs. Even [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] seems to have tried it, and far from sparingly.\n\nWhen the hundreds of gnolls made it to Graxarr to watch the Kult throw hundreds upon hundreds of slaves onto the pyre, the crowd seemed even more ecstatic than before, as if the Demon's Blood was aligning their desires with those of the demons they aimed to please...\n\nAfter the ceremony a doctor had to be called for [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] and many others, but all in all it was a good time!"

What's more, they have developed several variants of the drug, with different purposes:\n\nA variant intended for the military, which entices rage but diminishes sensations such as pain.\nA variant intended for the clergy, which does very little to enhance your sense of pleasure, the dosage and ingredients instead aim to induce very heavy demonic hallucinations and open up one's body to demonic powers.\nA variant intended for the upper classes, which is a bit milder than the usual recipe, but much safer. It allows for increased pleasure and can bring forth mild demonic hallucinations.\nA variant intended for both internal and external export is cheaper and more dangerous than the others, it makes one energetic and stimulates feelings of joy and lust. It can bring forth severe demonic hallucinations and even outright kill some.\n\nAll of these versions are highly addictive and are definitely going to be made illegal by foreign powers once they discover using it can lead to demonic visions, hallucinations, possessions and even summonings."

The kult urges preparations for repairs of the now dilapidated Citadel to begin at once."

She did not instil fear over the future of the republic though, she radiated success.\n\nAs feared as she was in life, as revered she is in death: Countless captains visit her open casket to pay their respects. It is commonplace that when a pirate captain dies, the remaining captains that remember them fondly will leave something of value in their casket to help pay for a proper funeral.

Or is there a greater purpose to all of this, some greater being who’s watching us with a plan, guiding our every step?

The first mate has donned an eyepatch and acquired a bird. \n\nYou shake the sand out of your grey fur and take a scared glance at Tsagon, who shares a wide-eyed look with you before pulling out a star chart from his coat and squinting at the sky. \n\n“I think we might’ve gotten a bad batch.” He muses, “It’s been three weeks. Weren’t these only supposed to last a couple hours?” \n\nYour hand goes to your side and checks your pouch, at one point filled with illicit tablets - now only containing a single one, the others likely consumed by those surrounding the wreckage.

Our captains are baffled; the crews have ample rations of salted meat and hardtack, enough to keep any warrior strong for many months. And in a pinch, they always have the targets of their raids to eat as well. \n\nIn a moment of desperation, one innovative captain authorized a captured halfling ‘chef’ to examine the afflicted sailors. The diminutive creature, shaking in his boots, taking nervous glances at the boiling pot by him that several of his compatriots have been tossed into, claims the issue isn’t lack of meat - but rather lack of… fruit? How absurd! Before being tossed into the stew, he cries that loading the ships with sour, brightly coloured produce will be the only cure and that he can help us procure some if we keep him alive."

But one intrepid member of the council has brought forth a very unique idea to continue to expand our wealth. Given that no one can prove that we are attacking their ships, what if we instead loaned our services out as protection, for an exorbitant fee of course. Naturally, any ships that we are escorting wouldn’t be attacked, and we could build a lovely reputation as all those who don’t take up our ‘generous’ offer see the errors of their ways from the wrong side of a capsized hull."

The contest, as usual, is conducted both with the participants in their normal state, and with them blindfolded. \n\nAs you judge the first segment, Tsagon, as usual, demolishes the competition, his brown eyes narrowed as he balances adroitly on the beam. You cheer and clap him on the back, and everyone gets ready for the blindfolded segment. \n\nTsagon immediately falls. You rush over to him as the rest of the participants take their turn, and as tears well up in his eyes, “I just don’t understand it. I’m fine with my eyes open. But the moment I close them, I can’t balance at all!” \n\nHe also describes feeling more tired than usual lately, having some weakness and loss of sensation in his arms and legs, and feeling tingling in his lower paws. He also says that for some reason he’s been way jumpy and his reflexes have been super fast, especially in his lower legs.

He continues talking. \n\n“This cluster of symptoms is actually a problem with something needed for the blood.

 mykx.47.d2:0 "The ship’s surgeon rushes over as you speak, shaking his head, “No, no.” He takes out his medical kit, “Good thought, but if there was a problem inside his head,” he says while he knocks on Tsagon’s skull, who protests loudly, “He would have trouble balancing with his eyes open as well, and he would have less reflexia, not more.” He takes a moment. “Also, he’d probably not be alive.” \n\nYou are confused.

In fact, eventually he wouldn’t even be able to breathe!” Tsagon’s brown eyes widen in terror as the ship’s surgeon claps him on the back. “Don’t worry lad, that’s not what you have.” \n\nYou are confused.

 mykx.45.t:0 "The Captive Market"
 mykx.45.d:0 "While many of our riches come from ‘liberated’ goods aboard wayward vessels in the Ruined Sea, there are subtler ways to line our coffers. One way that we have become rather infamous for is our sale of hallucinogens and opioids, generally banned across Halann. However, contacts within our markets in Western Cannor have been looking at something unique, which is a rather new venture for us. \n\nThe noble ‘Winelords’ of Lorent often sneer at our attempts to create Aelentiri vintage, but we can spice up our current supply by combining our other expertise, infusing our wine with subtle narcotics. The result, tested on captives caught from our raids, is a rather insidious and addictive drink. A pleasant lethargy, a calming of the nerves at first - but soon, the cravings become lasting. Yes, on first sip, they’ll scoff at the taste, but soon they’ll pay any price to keep the bottles coming.  \n\nTraditionalists and naval officers within our government, however, turn their snouts up at the idea - stating that if the Winelords want to look down on us, let them. We will torch their ports, sink their merchant fleets, and then they’ll have little use for their ‘superior’ vintage other than to drown their sorrows with."
 mykx.45.a:0 "A dastardly, brilliant plan. Begin the shipments!"

 mykx.46.t:0 "The Howling of the Hunt"
 mykx.46.d:0 "An exciting day on the patrol ship! Howls fill the air as the crew rushes to gather blades and weapons and man battle stations. You lock eyes with Tsagon Wethide, your best friend, his brown eyes filled with determination as he tosses you your blade. You catch it and turn to the merchant ship that has unknowingly entered dangerous waters. You don’t quite know what the flag is - vexillology was never your strength - but it doesn’t really matter. It isn’t Mykx, and thus is free food. As the ship turns hard to starboard, everyone’s feet are steady on the deck, trained by many years at sea. You can see activity beginning on the other ship as they notice your approach, and your ear twitches as you hear shouts begin to arise. \n\nAn arrow whizzes over your shoulder and lands into the wood of the deck, near the boxes filled with cannon ammo. You crouch down into a battle stance as the ship gets within boarding range, and your eyes drift to the ropes and hooks necessary to begin pulling the ship closer. As you do, you hear a cry for help come from the stern, near the quarterdeck. As a gnoll, the concept of ‘command’ is more of a suggestion, as those who fight the best in raids get the lion's share of the loot, leading to a taste for individuality in moments like these rather than following the orders of your captain. You think of the myriad of options ahead of you, knowing that Tsagon will follow your lead."
 mykx.46.a:0 "Grab the grappling hooks and toss - it’s time to board!"
 mykx.46.b:0 "Grab some ammo and man the cannons - cripple the enemy ship."
 mykx.46.c:0 "Look towards the navigator at the stern - go to help him."
 mykx.48.t:0 "Blood On The Deck"
 mykx.48.d:0 "You grab the grappling hooks and toss them towards the mast of the other ship - as they latch, you and Tsagon swing over and land on the deck, quickly dispatching two terrified humans with practiced strikes. Leading the charge, you howl as you continue plowing through the enemies topdeck - the fighting is brutal and chaotic, a whirlwind of steel and fury, fangs and gunpowder. As a man with a feathered cap lunges at you, Tsagon parries his blade just in time and you kick the unbalanced human overboard, sharing a wink with your friend. The air is thick with the smell of blood, and as you sniff, you notice the unmistakable insignia and luxury of a captain’s clothes from across the deck. You begin to rush that way, knowing that will gain you the most loot. But as you do, you hear a cry from behind you - turning, you see Tsagon cornered by two burly sailors with clubs as he tries to follow you."
 mykx.48.a:0 "Help Tsagon. No one hurts my friend!"
 mykx.48.b:0 "He can handle himself. Go for the riches!"
 mykx.49.t:0 "Comrades In Arms"
 mykx.49.d:0 "You snarl as you turn away from the ship’s captain - and the loot - and make your way back to your friend. As he dodges a swipe from one club, crashing into the deck and splintering the wood, you grab the hand of the other man rearing up for an overhand swing from behind. He grunts in surprise as you kick into the back of his knees, causing him to crumple to the ground, and Tsagon slits his throat. You grab the club from the now-lifeless body and swing it into the other, still recovering from his whiffed strike. You hear a distinct crack as several ribs shatter, and as he keels over, trickling red from his mouth, you know he’s out of the fight. You and Tsagon share a brief nod, and turn to see the captain of this mercantile vessel being brought down by your first mate. The sounds of battle cease as the haze of the sea mist and gunpowder obfuscates the scene of the crime, and the howls of the victorious Mykx pirates are joined by you and Tsagon as you begin to go belowdecks and grab everything you can carry."
 mykx.49.a:0 "Another successful boarding operation!"
 mykx.50.t:0 "Fight The Captain"
 mykx.50.d:0 "You snarl as you continue your course. Tsagon is a capable fighter, he’ll be alright. As you carve a path through, you see your first mate also on a beeline for the mercantile ship’s captain, and your pupils dilate and your breathing quickens even more as primitive instincts take over - the hunt is on. You leap over a swung sword and break another man’s hand as he tries to level a firearm at you, sliding underneath a piece of the mast broken from an errant cannonball as you reach the captain first - your first mate having been waylaid by a woman with the glint of magic at her fingertips. You strike first, but he expertly parries with a dagger before attempting to return the favor - gashing across your shoulder. You suppress a whimper as you grab his arm and bring him closer in, biting down and tasting blood. He cries out, and your blade finds its mark between his ribs in the moment of surprise. The humans for some reason always expect you to fight fair. As his limp body falls, a quiet hush falls over the ship, and the sounds of battle cease, though the haze of sea mist and gunpowder remain. The howls of the victorious Mykx pirates begin, and fortunately you hear Tsagon’s voice within. You join, quickly pilfering through the captain’s pockets and then joining the rest of your crew belowdecks to grab everything you can carry."
 mykx.50.a:0 "Another successful boarding operation!"
 mykx.51.t:0 "A Thunderous Reply"
 mykx.51.d:0 "You nod to the cannons and Tsagon, from years of working together, implicitly understands what you mean. You race to the nearest cannon as Tsagon behind you grabs several crates worth of ammo and heaves them over to you. The work is hot and heavy as you pack the chamber, ramming powder and shot as the ship rocks from the waves, arrows and bullets careen past, and the shouts from those who decided to board carry over the water. Your grey fur is slick - whether from water, sweat, or the blood of the crewman who had fallen next to him, you have no idea. The enemy attempts to maneuver away but they’re still easily in range. The only question now is whether to pack with grapeshot and fire across the deck to inflict casualties, or to fire a solid hit straight at their mast and cripple them so they have nowhere to go."
 mykx.51.a:0 "Hit the deck - any survivors will be too demoralized to fight."
 mykx.51.b:0 "Hit the mast - we can't loot the ship if it runs away from us."
 mykx.52.t:0 "Scatterblast"
 mykx.52.d:0 "You dodge another arrow as you pack in the grapeshot, light the fuse and duck behind the ship's railing with Tsagon, flashing him a toothy grin. After about 3 seconds… BOOM! The cannon bucks as it fires the payload, and you look over to see that it has decimated the forces on the deck preparing to fight the oncoming gnolls, though some of the more frenzied feet-first into action types got hit in the blast too. The first mate nods at you as he grabs a grappling hook and swings onto the ship, heading straight for the mercantile ship’s captain, yelling orders from the quarterdeck. Quickly, the remaining sailors surrender, and the victorious howls of the Mykx crew reverberate throughout the night, yours and Tsagon’s joining them. While you won’t gain the vast majority of the loot not being on the boat itself, the first mate does give you more than a fair share considering your contribution to the battle."
 mykx.52.a:0 "A well-fired shot."
 mykx.53.t:0 "Calculated Shot"
 mykx.53.d:0 "You whistle gleefully as you pack in the cannonball, swing the cannon towards the mast, and light the fuse, one eye closed as you aim and make the requisite calculations in your head to ensure that your fire strikes true. You may not have done well at vexillology - but you were always a whiz at kinematics and mechanics. Tsagon bats away an arrow with his shield, and you both hunker down behind the railing as… BOOM! The cannon bucks and fires, and you hear the unmistakable splintering of wood, and then a second crash as said wood smashes down onto the deck of the mercantile ship, crushing a strangely well-dressed human woman underneath it. With the hooks in and the mast down, the other ship quickly comes to a stop, and as the first mate gives you a clap on the back, the surviving sailors on the other ship throw their weapons to the ground and surrender. The victorious howls of your crew bounce off of the waves, and you and Tsagon gleefully join them. While you won’t gain the vast majority of the loot not being on the boat itself, the first mate does give you more than a fair share considering your contribution to the battle."
 mykx.53.a:0 "A well-fired shot."
 mykx.54.t:0 "Man The Helm"
 mykx.54.d:0 "Your ears twitch as you hear the familiar sound of your navigator cry out in pain. You grab Tsagon’s shoulder as he goes for the grappling hooks and point in that direction. His brown eyes squint, and then widen, before he looks back at you, having seen the same thing you did - the navigator has gone down, and everyone is too busy trying to gain their share of the loot to notice. \n\n“Someone’s got to man the helm.” You nod, and begin to rush that way. Climbing up the stairs on all fours, you reach the wheel, and see the navigator, his bronze fur matted with blood around his shoulder from a gunshot wound. \n\nHe coughs, red sputum splattering across the deck, and points ahead, weakly sputtering ‘The reefs… They’re trying to lead us into The Dragon’s Teeth.” You look and see the plan - their narrower boat could more easily fit into the treacherous, narrow channel through the rocks, and potentially trap your own ship, unless well maneuvered. \n\nYou look at Tsagon. He’s been practicing at the helm lately, and he knows exactly what you're thinking. But his usual look of easy confidence is gone, and he’s terrified. You grip his shoulder; “You got this. I’ll cover you.” He takes a deep breath, and nods, grabbing the helm as you pull up a shield nearby to protect him from any retaliation. But when you check back in, he’s looking back at you. You know exactly what he’s thinking - do we try to avoid the reefs entirely? Or try to outsail them inside?"
 mykx.54.a:0 "We’ll out-sail them in the reefs. Their plan will be their doom!"
 mykx.54.b:0 "Push to port and broadside them to avoid the reefs entirely!"
 mykx.55.t:0 "The Dragon's Teeth"
 mykx.55.d:0 "Tsagon sets his jaw, and takes a quick breath, lifting his shoulders up and down in a practiced motion as he spins the wheel, following the mercantile ship's path towards the narrow channel. You narrow your eyes as you see a human woman reach up from the side of the ship and point at you with her finger - and then out comes a bolt of fire! You quickly block it with the steel shield, before dropping it as the heat radiating through it becomes too much to hold. When you look back, the woman has been struck down by your first mate, who gives you and Tsagon a hearty nod, before turning to a burly man with a club. \n\nYou look again to the bow, and see that you have entered the channel, with Tsagon expertly guiding the ship through the foaming spray and jagged rocks. The other vessel, expecting an easy escape, begins to lag as more hooks fly out, and as their wheel is turned frantically, a sickening crunch is heard as they run aground. They have nowhere to go. Your crew begins to howl in victory as the remaining living sailors throw down their weapons and surrender. And you embrace Tsagon in a massive hug, before breaking off and joining the howls."
 mykx.55.a:0 "Unbelievable finesse at the helm!"
 mykx.56.t:0 "Pinning"
 mykx.56.d:0 "The insane gamble is not worth the cost. Tsagon quickly turns the wheel and turns the ship to port and a little ahead of the mercantile vessel and begins pressing the ships hulls together, allowing even more hungry gnolls to jump on board. As the creak of wood against wood is heard, you lift your shield up and block three arrows coming at Tsagon’s head. He gives you an appreciative smile, which you return before turning your eyes back on the other deck, now filled with a haze of smoke, gunpowder, and sea-mist. The larger size of your vessel as well as Tsagon’s expert steering allows you to easily push out the mercantile vessel away from The Dragon’s Teeth - and as the mass of gnolls frenzies on the deck, the captain manning the wheel calls for a surrender, knowing his gambit has failed. Head down, he throws down his weapon, and his crew follows in turn, as the howls of the victorious gnolls drowns out the sound of the breaking wood.  You and Tsagon join in the celebration, and the captain of your vessel gives you a solemn nod, understanding the sacrifice you two made to take up your position instead of rushing for the loot on the boat."
 mykx.56.a:0 "Masterful control of the wheel!"
