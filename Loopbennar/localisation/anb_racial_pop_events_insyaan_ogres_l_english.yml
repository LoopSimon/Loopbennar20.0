 ogre_tolerance_events.30.t:0 "The Bloom of the Plateau"
 ogre_tolerance_events.30.d:0 "Missives have entered your chambers talking of a meticulously tended garden, unlike any cultivation the realm has seen before, hidden in the heights of the Great Plateau. They speak of rows of a peculiar root stretching across terraced slopes, their leaves a deep, almost black green.\n\nThe advisors huddle amongst themselves, then split into two camps. One side opposes anything to do with it.\n\n“Let’s leave it all together, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]; the beasts who inhabit the planes are far too cruel to anger.”\n\nThe latter group insists that an expedition is sent."
 ogre_tolerance_events.30.a:0 "Send a scouting party to survey the fields."
 ogre_tolerance_events.30.b:0 "What use are a bunch of plants?"
 ogre_tolerance_events.30.c:0 "I’m something of a greenthumb myself - send the gardeners some aid!"
 ogre_tolerance_events.30.e:0 "Mulch for our farmers at least."
 ogre_tolerance_events.30.f:0 "It seems they do not have the right paperwork; send in the tax-man!"

 ogre_tolerance_events.31.t:0 "A Meticulous Garden"
 ogre_tolerance_events.31.d:0 "The scouting party has returned, and with them crates upon crates overflowing with vegetables the size of Solewood logs. The party’s leader emerges from the pack, unable to hide his grin. \n\n“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],” his voice boomed, “it was a sight to behold!” The rest of his crew hurried along to bring in what remained of the crops.\n\n“Our journey was not an easy one; we set out at first light of the fifth day, crossing the canyons where the wind howled and the rocks threatened to give way under our feet. But after a full day of climbing, we reached the Great Plateau – with nothing but the silver shine of the moon to guide us, we caught sight of that verdant patch, and what a beauty it was!”\n\nThe commander laughs heartily as his crew unload a cornucopia of colossal herbs and roots of all colours, alongside some luminous and jagged greens rivalling the size of Kanolowele’s greatest beer barrels. The leader gestures at the magnitude of their acquisitions. \n\n“These will feed our people for many winters,” and he laughed once more.\n\nHis laugh is an infectious one, with his entourage sharing in the fray, but the advisors at [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s side eye the food with a nervous expression. What should the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] do with this tribute?"
 ogre_tolerance_events.31.a:0 "Distribute it to all in [Root.Country.GetName]."
 ogre_tolerance_events.31.b:0 "The Royal Banquet will be the largest yet!"
 ogre_tolerance_events.31.c:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s men shall never go hungry again!"
 ogre_tolerance_events.31.e:0 "After all, why shouldn’t I keep it?"
 ogre_tolerance_events.31.f:0 "Perhaps we misunderstood these ‘Skyfall Ogres’?"
