 xhazobkult_events.101.t:0 "A Kult of Many Faces"
 xhazobkult_events.101.d:0 "As the saying goes, ask ten different gnolls what the Xhazobkult is and you will get eleven different answers. This is what the Xhazobkult truly is; a collection of folk traditions, rituals and practices rather than an organized religion. However, such details escape the civilized world. To them the Xhazobkult is merely a bastion of demon worship with no nuance or cultural history.\n\nAs we progress down the path towards joining the civilized world perhaps it would be best for us to abandon the more demonic elements of our faith.\n\nOur nation has long integrated elements of the so-called "civilized religions", and a public conversion to one of these faiths could enhance our standing in the world."

 xhazobkult_events.100.t:0 "Gnolls Do Their Own Ritual"
 xhazobkult_events.100.d:0 "Urgent news, a pack of impatient gnolls in [event_province.GetName] have gathered some menials in order to enact a sacrifice of their own, they are already performing the initial rituals to prepare a pyre. Some have even taken to gorging their thirst for blood on a few hapless sacrifices.\n\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must act quickly and decide on what to do with these unruly gnolls, as any sign of doubt and weakness could be a bad omen before a sacrifice."
 xhazobkult_events.100.a:0 "Let the ritual continue."
 xhazobkult_events.100.b:0 "I decide when sacrifices are made!"


 xhazobkult_events.200.a:0 "Prepare it's construction!"
 xhazobkult_events.202.t:0 "A death by inches"
 xhazobkult_events.202.d:0 "[hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] feels those covetous eyes upon them again. They are near, of this [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] is certain. It began with the fall of the capital. Even before the message arrived, [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] knew. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt the insistent pinprick of eyes watching. Someone, or something was scrying on them, using a method they did not know how to counter. This was frustrating, but [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] was fairly certain that it relied on some sort of sympathy. With the capital in their grasp, the scryer had plenty of personal items, and people, to draw from. This by itself was worrying. The hunters were worse.\n\nThey were gnolls, [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] was certain. But they were silent for gnolls. None of the usual vocalizations. The snarling, the laughing, nothing of the sort. They were mute. And they knew magic. Not war-magic as [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] knew it, but some sort of affinity with darkness. They leapt from shadow to shadow, hid in plain sight; wherever the sun was absent, they seemed to linger.\n\nThat would all be well and good, if they were simply watching. But [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] knew with a grim certainty that they were waiting. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] was used to assassins, but this feeling of being hunted was exhausting. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not know what these things wanted with them, and [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] did not care.\n\nThe capital would have to be retaken. The scryer's eye would have to be blinded. And soon.\n\n[hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] knew that [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] was running out of time."

Already, scryers rifle through [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Capital.GetName]s belongings, while others hunt down their nearest and dearest for details on their whereabouts.

 xhazobkult_events.205.t:0 "The Abyss"
 xhazobkult_events.205.d:0 "The first thing [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] felt was the smoke. Noxious vapours, invading [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHis] body with every breath, dense and cold. It smelled like burning flesh. It made [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHis] lungs ache.\n\nAwareness gradually returned to [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName]. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes open, but saw nothing. Had [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] been blinded? [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] instinctively moved [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands to their eyes, but a hot lance of pain shot through [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHis] palms. They had been bound - No, nailed together, with a single heavy bolt. They attempted flexing their fingers. Nothing.\n\n[hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] tried to recall. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHe] had slept. Protected by guards and wards, yet these... things, had passed through them, invading their dreams, binding them and stealing them away. And [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName]had awoken... Here. Wherever here was.\n\n[hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetName] attempted to orient [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHim]self. [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] felt [hunt_for_powerful_mages_victim.Monarch.GetHerHis] cheek against a cold surface. Not stone, but similar. Finely ground wood or bone perhaps. They attempted to rise, but their knees flared up in pain. Broken. Of course. Then they tried to speak, their voice echoing through the darkness.\n\n"Hello?"\n\nA careful voice. And yet, it felt loud. Invasive, as it flooded into this silent place.\n\nThere was no answer."
 xhazobkult_events.205.a:0 "Where am I?"
 xhazobkult_events.206.t:0 "Gone"
 xhazobkult_events.206.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been taken. For some time now, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had spoken of a creeping shadow, lingering at the edge of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sight. Some sort of demonic scrying, against which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could mount no defense. Our magical experts were rallied to counter this vile sorcery. The guard was doubled, wards were set in place, and we were certain that whatever magical blow was struck against us, we would counter it.\n\nAnd when the blow came, our wards did indeed spring to work. Our guards were ready, and the fighting was fierce, but our foes struck from the darkness itself, blurring the line between the waking world and some twisted dreamscape as they invaded [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s resting place. \n\nIn the end, it was too little. Many of the shadows were slain, but our wards were shaken, then breached. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had seemingly been struck with some curse, for [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was locked in a torpor, even as the battle raged around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. A shadow reached [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], and they both vanished. \n\nThis was a defeat, but even now our mages are analyzing the battle, and they believe they have found a countermeasure. While this is cold comfort to [Root.Monarch.GetName], it should keep the succession from sharing their fate, at least for the foreseeable future."

 ###Great Xhaz events
 xhazobkult_events.3000.t:0 "Fair Is Foul, Foul Is Fair"
 xhazobkult_events.3000.d:0 "The ritual pyres burned high, flames licking the darkened sky with tongues of crimson, amber, and black. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood before the altar. Around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet, a circle of blood glistened. Screams and cries echoed in the surrounding night - pleas of the doomed, swallowed by ever-more-fervorous chants, building to a crescendo.\n\nAt first, silence. The wind stilled. The stars dimmed. The fires ceased their crackling. And then, a sound. A deep, guttural rasp, like claws dragging over stone.\n\n"You call to me, supplicant." The air twisted, though the smoke remained formless and twisted. "You come to beg for power, to claim dominion over mortal flesh and flame. But power is not given - it is bought with blood, with pain, with life."\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] knelt, baring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] claws to the great demon, voice steady despite the growing weight on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest.\n\n“I seek your favour, great Xhazob. Speak your price, and it will be paid.” As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finished, a jagged, pulsating sigil burned itself into [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s chest. A torrent of demonic energy surged outward, siphoned from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] into the smoke, now shifting to form a gaping, grinning maw.\n\n"I demand strength, mortal. A river must flow from you to me. I will feed until I deem your meagre offerings enough. And know this: should you falter, your flesh will be my feast, your soul my toy for eternity."\n\n"Bring me the blood of a thousand thousand souls. Only then will my favour be yours."\n\nThe Xhazob vanished, the fires roaring back to life. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood, breathing laboured, fur singed, but resolve unbroken, even as the air rang with the demon’s final question."

 xhazobkult_events.3001.t:0 "Something Wicked This Way Comes"
 xhazobkult_events.3001.d:0 "The roar of the pyre, the beating of the drums, the screams of the sacrifices, cackling laughter. A sinister symphony rings out across the vast camp, gnolls gathered in their tens of thousands to witness the birth of the next [Root.xhaz_gender_tt].\n\nFor days now they have cavorted, slaughtered and feasted amongst the many concentric circles of hellish green pyres that make up the ritual site. Lesser demons have crawled forth from these smaller pyres to join the carnage, summoned by the vile celebrations of the horde.\n\nIn the centre of this orchestra of sin lies the grand pyre unto which [Root.Monarch.GetName] has spent the last week casting thousands of sacrifices to their fiery doom. Their red-rimmed eyes flicker with madness as a dry cackle escapes their bloodstained maw. In a frenzy they turn upon one of the assembled shamans who have been aiding them, ripping out their throat with fang and claw. In a flash of blinding speed [Root.Monarch.GetName] has slain five more of their number. Those that survive begin to flee but [Root.Monarch.GetName] snaps out a command in an unearthly tongue, compelling the shamans to turn and attend to them.\n\nThe six bodies of the slain shamans are thrown into the flames before [Root.Monarch.GetName] beckons over the ensorcelled survivors. Wordlessly they begin to bind the supplicant in blackened ironwood chains. [Root.Monarch.GetName] grins manically as they are trussed up and thrown into the pyre themselves. Silence descends briefly over the camp. All of Halann seems to hold its breath for a moment in time.\n\nThe earth shudders. A deafening explosion rocks the area. Blinding green light flares as the central pyre explodes outwards, engulfing those gathered around it. Luminous, blazing green eyes appear within the oily blackness of the smoke. A rumbling cackle echoes for miles around. [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerges from the darkness, their body monstrously swollen and warped by the demonic power of the Xhazob that now dwells within them, hellfire trailing in their wake.\n\nThe horde erupts into screams of exultation; for many miles around crops begin to wither and cattle keel over, spewing burning black bile. A [Root.xhaz_gender_tt] stalks the mortal world once more."

Not a whisper is heard across the grand camp; all await the outcome with bated breath. The calm before the storm.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] but moments ago threw themselves into the grand pyre at the centre of the camp, the apex of a week-long orgy of violence and debauchery in which sacrifices had been made to the great demonic spirit. Despite the scale of the event,  it must be said that the shamans have been uneasy about the relatively paltry offerings [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been able to gather.\n\nThe silence is broken. Not by a roar of triumph, but a scream of terror. Writhing in agony, [Root.Monarch.GetName] emerges from the flames burnt and twisted, held in the titanic jaws of a monstrous creature of shadow and flame. So incensed by this meagre sacrifice is the Xhazob that the mighty demon seeks to punish the upstart gnolls directly. \n\nDays later, the few survivors would describe the Xhazob wreaking an unspeakable slaughter upon the assembled horde, annihilating our leadership and leaving our armies in total disarray. Our realm is on the brink of disintegration and the many lesser packs held together by (dead monarch name) are already gathering their forces to try and seize power or break away."

On the night before the latest Great Xhaz was declared, [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s profane brand ignited into emerald hellfire. A great bestial form spewed forth from their brow, tethered by a tendril of flame. The primal spirit of the Xhazob engulfed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who died screaming in agony. Not even ash was left when the flames finally flickered out.\n\nOur realm is in disarray, and to add insult to injury, many of our warriors have already abandoned us and flocked to the banners of the new Xhazobine. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has failed us!"
